## Cross-Language-Plagiarism-Detection

1. Code.ipynb contains the entire code required to implement this tool
2. The 3 ZIP Files are required for the executions procedure [they currently contain only 5 sample Technical Papers]
3. There are a few prerequisites or steps to follow before the User can start off with the Plagiarism Check:
    - The User should ensure that the whatever Documents they want to have as a Corpus/Source, they must be contained in a zip file in their original (untranslated)            versions
    - The User should ensure that the whatever Documents they want to have as a Corpus/Source, they must be contained in another zip file in their derived (translated)         versions 
    - The User should ensure that whichever document they want to analyse as the Suspicious Document must be contained in another zip file
      All of the above zip files must be contained in the current folder
4. Once the execution of the Code/Application starts, the User would be prompted 3 times:
    - Firstly, to enter the name of the zip File which stores the Original Untranslated Corpus
    - Secondly, to enter the name of the zip File which stores the Derived Translated Corpus
    - Thirdly, to enter the name of the zip File which stores the Suspicious Document
5. Requirements/Points covered:
    - Context of words: Through N-gram model
    - Mapping to source: Hover Feature in Heatmap and Tabulated data
    - Visualise Overall plagiarism: Through Heatmap and Textbox Highlight
    - Generate report: Through Pie Charts and Tabulated Data
    - Detailed Information of Source Documents and their language: Through Table and Clickable Links embedded in it
